# PHP Silent Array Key Access: Unexpected Null Values

This repository demonstrates a common yet subtle error in PHP: the silent handling of undefined array keys.  When you try to access an array element using a non-existent key, PHP returns `null` without raising an error. This can lead to unexpected behavior and make debugging challenging.

The `bug.php` file shows the problematic code, while `bugSolution.php` offers a solution using isset() or the null coalescing operator to handle such cases safely.
