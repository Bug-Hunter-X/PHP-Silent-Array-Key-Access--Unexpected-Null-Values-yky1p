In PHP, a common yet subtle error arises when dealing with array keys that are not explicitly defined.  If you try to access an array element using a key that doesn't exist, PHP won't throw an error; instead, it'll return `null`. This can lead to unexpected behavior, especially when performing calculations or concatenations without proper null checks.  For example:

```php
$myArray = ['a' => 1, 'b' => 2];
$result = $myArray['c'] + 5; // $myArray['c'] is null, resulting in 5
$concatenation = "Value: " . $myArray['d']; // $myArray['d'] is null, resulting in "Value: "
```

This silent failure can be difficult to debug, as the code might appear to run without errors, yet produce incorrect results.
